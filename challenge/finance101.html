<h2 id="financial-instruments">Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>At Jane Street, we trade many different financial instruments. For this
competition, we will focus on a few basic types.</p>
<h3 id="bonds">Bonds</h3>
<p>A bond is a form of debt. The buyer supplies some capital to
the seller, and in exchange the seller agrees to pay back that amount
plus interest at a fixed time in the future.</p>
<h3 id="stocks">Stocks</h3>
<p>A share of stock is a financial instrument that represents the partial
ownership of the company that issued it. The buyer supplies
capital to the company, and in exchange receives ownership of a small
fraction of the company. The buyer hopes that the company will pay out
dividends to its shareholders and/or that the company's share value
will increase so that they can sell the shares at a higher price than
they bought them.</p>
<h3 id="adrs">ADRs</h3>
<p>Investors may want to invest in foreign companies without having
to trade on foreign exchanges. An ADR (American Depository Receipt)
is a receipt issued by a US bank that trades on a US exchange but
represents a share in a foreign stock. An investor can pay the ADR
issuer a fee to convert between the ADR and the corresponding foreign
stock. An ADR can be thought of as a special case of an ETF
(explained below) with only one component.</p>
<h3 id="etfs">ETFs</h3>
<p>Investors may want to invest in a market as a whole instead of in a
single stock. For example, one might want to invest in the S&amp;P 500,
an index of the 500 biggest US companies. However, for the average
investor, going out and buying 500 different stocks would be expensive
and time consuming. ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) provide an easier and
cheaper alternative. An ETF trades on the market like an ordinary
stock, but it represents a basket of instruments. For instance, the
SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has an underlying basket made up of the 500 stocks in
the S&amp;P 500, so an easy way to invest in the US market as a whole is
to buy this ETF. Just like for ADRs, an investor can pay the ETF
issuer a fee to convert between the ETF and its corresponding
basket. The actions of converting to and from an ETF are called
'creating the ETF' and 'redeeming the ETF' respectively.</p>
<h2 id="orders">Orders</h2>
<p>In the most basic sense, trading consists of buying and selling securities. 
An order is an instruction sent to an exchange to buy or
sell a security, with certain constraints. The most common kind of
order is a 'limit' order, which places a limit on the price at which you are
willing to buy or sell.</p>
<p>The parameters that specify a limit order are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the security you want to trade</li>
<li>Whether you want to buy or sell it</li>
<li>The 'limit' price, i.e. the 'worst' price you're willing to trade
  at (i.e. the highest price if you're buying, or the lowest price if you're selling)</li>
<li>How many shares / contracts of the security you want to trade</li>
</ul>
<p>A 'bid' price is the limit price specified by a buy order, and an
'offer' or 'ask' price is the limit price specified by a sell order.</p>
<h2 id="stock-exchanges">Stock Exchanges</h2>
<p>A lot of our trading occurs on exchanges, which are highly regulated electronic
marketplaces that match up buyers and sellers in the following way:</p>
<p>Suppose you're the first person to send an order that day. You send an order to buy
10 BOND for $995. No-one is willing to trade against you right now, so the
exchange just enters your order into the 'book' and it sits there. This is called
a 'resting order'.</p>

<p>Let's say someone else comes along and also sends an order to buy 100
BOND for $995. They can't trade with you ' you both want to buy. So now the book
looks like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<td align="right"></td>
<td align="right"></td>
<td align="right"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the exchange displays the sum of all of the orders at a given price
point and doesn't divide it up into the individual orders.</p>
<p>A few more people come in and send: an order to sell 500 BOND at $1001, an
order to sell 50 BOND at $1002, and an order to sell 3000 BOND at $1005. There is
still no trading ' the most anyone is willing to buy for is $995, but the least
anyone is willing to sell at is $1001. At this point, we say 'the
market in BOND is $995 at $1001', meaning the 'best' (i.e. highest) bid is $995 and
the 'best' (i.e. lowest) offer is $1001.</p>

<td align="right">$1005</td>
<td align="right">3000</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Finally, someone comes along and sends an order to sell 30 BOND at $995.
This can trade with the buy orders. Which orders get 'filled'? First the 10-contract
buy order gets fully filled, as it was on the exchange first (this is called
'price-time priority': the orders are sorted first by price, and then by age).
The owner of the buy order gets a message from the exchange telling them how many of their
contracts traded (all 10 in this case). Now there are 20 contracts left from the 30-contract
sell order. Next, the 100-contract buy order gets partially filled with the remaining 20 contracts.
The owner of this buy order gets a message from the exchange as well, telling them 20 of their
contracts traded. And of course, the owner of the sell order also gets a message (or possibly
multiple messages) about their fills.</p>
<p>After that's all done, the book looks like this:</p>

<h3 id="price-improvement">Price improvement</h3>
<p>Any given trade is always between an order that was previously on the
book (the resting order), and one that comes in and never gets
entered into the book.</p>
<p>The price of a trade is always that of the <em>resting</em> order. For
example, if there is a resting order to buy for $80, and someone sends
an order to sell at $70, a trade happens at $80.</p>
<h2 id="the-business-of-market-making">The business of market making</h2>
<p>Market making is one way that firms participate on the financial markets. The
purpose of market making is to act as an intermediary for other people's trading.
For example, suppose Alice wants to buy some shares, and Bob wants to sell some.
It seems good for them to trade with each other, but if we require that they
meet at the exchange at the same time, this is not likely to be efficient. If
this were really how markets worked, you might be afraid to invest. Who knows
whether you'd be lucky enough to find a buyer when you wanted to sell?
And if you did find a counterparty, how would you agree on a fair price?</p>
<p>Market makers are always willing to buy and always willing to sell. They have
some conception of how much a security is worth right now (its 'fair value'),
but no long term interest in owning the security. Market makers are always willing
to buy for slightly below the fair value and sell at slightly above it. You can
think of market making a bit like running a supermarket: you are simply the link
between the sellers of goods (wholesale producers) and the buyers (shoppers).
You charge some premium on your wholesale purchase price in order to make a profit.</p>
<p>Unlike a supermarket however, a market maker can sell a security that they don't
currently own, called 'short selling', and end up with a negative
'position' (quantity that they own) in that security. You should try
to keep your position close to 0 in order to limit your exposure to
large price moves, on which you don't really have a long-term opinion.</p>
<p>Note that it's wrong to think of trading as strictly a zero-sum game. In
particular, there will be other participants in the <code>etc</code> market beyond the
bots you create. Some of these might act like 'investors' ' people just
wishing to buy (or sell) securities, who want to hold that position for a long
time, putting capital at risk in order to earn a return. They're not very
sensitive to the price, since they mostly just trust that the market has the
fair price for the security right now. So they're likely to buy or sell on
whatever market they see. Other participants are competing with you ' they
have a rough idea of what they think the security is worth, and they'll try to
buy below that and sell above it.</p>
<h2 id="some-basic-trading-strategies">Some basic trading strategies</h2>
<p>The basic strategy is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have some idea of a fair value for each security</li>
<li>Attempt to buy the security for less than fair, and sell it at more than fair</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fair-values">Fair values</h3>
<p>How might you come up with a fair value in the first place? Since markets (both
in the real world and in this competition) tend to be fairly efficient most of
the time, a good starting assumption is that the fair value is
probably between the best bid and best offer; half-way between these
(the 'mid') is usually a good starting guess.</p>
<p>There are some classes of securities for which coming up with a better fair is
relatively straightfoward. For example, as mentioned above, ETFs
represent a basket of other securities. If there is an ETF called FRED, and one
share of FRED contains 0.5 shares of HENRY and 4 shares of EMMA, then it should
be fairly clear what the fair value for FRED is given a fair values for HENRY and
EMMA.</p>
<p>For non-ETF securities, it is less obvious what you might do. In
general, predicting whether a stock will go up or down is hard, so it
is unlikely you will be able to make money by betting on a stock going
up or down. That said, it can still be possible to make money by
providing liquidity in these stocks, but we will give no further
hints in this section :)</p>
<h3 id="trading-from-your-fair-value">Trading from your fair value</h3>
<p>It may seem that all the trickery is in coming up with a fair, and indeed it is
possible to do some very complex things in that space. But it's also not
obvious how to trade around it. Let's look at some basic ideas.</p>
<p>If you think a financial security is worth exactly $100, it is impossible to
make money by sending buy or sell orders at exactly $100. Obviously, you'll
want to send buy orders below $100 and sell orders above $100. The difference
between the price of your order or fill and your fair value is called the edge.
More precisely:</p>
<pre><code>edge = dir_sign * (fair value - order price)
where dir_sign = 1 for buying and -1 for selling
</code></pre>
<p>The way to think about edge is that it is the profit you earn by completing
that trade.</p>
<p>So given a fair value, where should you send orders? Let's look at two ideas:</p>
<h3 id="pennying">Pennying</h3>
<p>You want to earn the most edge you can. Pennying is the idea of looking at
the current best bid and offer, and sending orders the minimum amount 'inside'
that, i.e. sending a buy order for <code>current best bid + 1</code> and/or a sell order at
<code>current best offer - 1</code>.</p>
<p>This kind of strategy is an example of 'providing liquidity'. You place orders on the
book, and when price-insensitive investors come along to trade, they find your orders
already sitting there, and trade against them.</p>
<h3 id="taking">Taking</h3>
<p>On rare occasions, you might believe that the fair value is outside the current
best bid and offer, in which case you might want to trade with the current
market. For example, if you think <code>fair value &gt; current best offer</code>, you might
send a buy order at <code>current best offer</code> to trade with the offer.</p>
<p>This kind of strategy is often referred to as 'taking liquidity'.</p>
<p>WARNING: You generally need to have a good idea of fair value to make money by
taking liquidity! Remember markets are generally fairly efficient most of the time!</p>
